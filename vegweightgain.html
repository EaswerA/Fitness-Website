        <p style="font-size: 30px; margin: 40px;">Vegan foods are generally less calorie dense than animal-sourced foods. That means vegans may have to eat more to reach
        their daily calorie goal. Rather than eating three huge meals, It is recommended having five or six smaller meals spread
        approximately three hours apart over the course of the day.</p>
